{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><em><strong>TL;DR</strong> - I built a tool - <a href=\"https://tweetfancy.io/\">tweetfancy.io</a> to tweet in bold, italics and strikethrough text.</em></p>\n<p>Ever fancied tweeting with <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> or <del>strikethrough</del> text?</p>\n<p>Twitter doesn't allow its users to format tweets. But having an option to <em>emphasize</em> or <strong>call out</strong> a word or a phrase in a tweet might come in handy at times.</p>\n<h1>Announcing tweetfancy.io</h1>\n<p>I recently realized that the UTF charset has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols\">characters and symbols</a> that look like <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> or <del>strikethrough</del> ascii characters. So I built a tool that generates these characters which could be copied and pasted into almost any website out there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write your original text in markdown</li>\n<li>The editor will generate text for you to copy/paste</li>\n<li>Tweet directly from the editor</li>\n<li>Copy/Paste the generated text into any website (FB/Insta/etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: The generated characters are mathematical symbols and not actual English alphabets. So if you run them by a screen reader, you'll find that the reader reads them out by their symbol name. But then, all screen readers struggle reading smileys too (ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸ¦„ðŸ˜Ž) and that doesn't stop us from using smileys. So,we might use this as well.</em></p>\n<p>Here's the link - <a href=\"https://tweetfancy.io/\">tweetfancy.io</a></p>\n<p>Go bonkers tweeting in <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> or <del>strikethrough</del>! Happy tweeting! ðŸŽ‰</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tweet in bold, italics and strikethrough text","date":"January 22, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tweet-fancy/"}}
